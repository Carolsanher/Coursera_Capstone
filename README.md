# Coursera_Capstone


The repository contains the final capstone project. The aim is to identify  juice bars in the different neighbourhoods of the Bay Area and to find out the best possible neighbourhood for locating a new juice bar that is near universities and gyms. Universities and gyms have a very high probability of having a high percentage of customer base that might consume natural juices as part of a healthy life style. Therefore we think placing a juice bar nearby these venues and selecting the right neighbourhood would provide with enough customers to create a profit.
